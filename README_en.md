# RISC-V ISA CI

CI/CD for RISC-V cores

Software designed to test processors based on the RISC-V architecture. The software covers tests from the synthesis of the processor in HDL (Verilog or VHDL) to the execution of instructions with the processor operating on an FPGA.

# Implemented Parts

- [x] Clone and Pull from GIT repositories
- [x] Synthesis of Core(s)/SoC(s)
- [ ] Standardization of pinouts for various FPGAs
- [ ] Verification of the synthesis process
- [ ] Writing to FPGA
- [ ] Serial debugger with the FPGA
- [ ] Execution of instructions
- [ ] Automated sending of memory files to FPGA
